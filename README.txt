#Getting Started:

#Colour Scheme:
https://color.adobe.com/create/image was used to get color schemes
The colour scheme used in index.html is generally:

#D0D7D9
#ffffff
#1CA5BA
For text^

#333333
#012E40
For background^

The colour scheme in Page1.html is generally:

#ff90ff
#D0D7D9
#ffffff
For text^

#333333
For background^

The colour in Page2.html is generally:

#ff90ff
#D0D7D90
For text^

#333333
#242424
For background^

I made 2 other color schemes using similiar concepts where I casn change the color of ofnt without really affecting the 

 * ColorScheme1:
 * #A83B5E
 * white
 * pink
 * #D0D7D9
 * #7EDDF2
 * #012E40

 * ColorScheme2:
 * #2AA837
 * #A83B5E
 * #F56F9A
 
 * #C12F20
 * #BEA96A
 * #F5F7DF

I took lighter colors as the scheme for Fonts and a contrasting darker colour as the background

#javascript.js 
It contains methods that are called from the html using buttons and inputs.
It has the code that changes the color scheme using "for" loops instead of the css file because I was aiming for everything to finish in the javascrit file and not the CSS file

1)Notifications: 
The submit button gives a notification if the submitted values are not empty, it says: "Form Submitted successfully!", Otherwise it "Form not submitted properly, Please check details and try again!"

2)Conditional:
The Submit button uses conditional to tell us if The user has inputted correct values.

3)Colour Chnager:
The color schemes are easily changeable through the Nav bar.

4)Event Handler:
The Buttons on footer change audio using onclick and hence respond to the user by changing the song


#Use of selectors:

-The universal selector gives 5 padding to every element
-Child selector puts A different text size and color for h3 coming after dv on line 173 in the styles.css.
-Sibling html was used to put the size of h1 to large after the meta tag at line 179 line in styles.css
-Multiple selectors were sued to give common values to some styles in .abtme and .abtme2 at line 98 in styles.css
-Pseudo-element Selector was used to put the colour of background and text when text is selected using ::selectyion tag at line 64
